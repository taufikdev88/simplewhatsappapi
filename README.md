TO DO

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Development
Build docker image for multi platform

- Create new builder if it doesn't exist yet
```bash
#!/bin/bash
docker buildx create --name mybuilder --use --bootstrap
```
- Trigger the build using buildx for multi-arch
```bash
#!/bin/bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t docker-image-name:tag-version --push .
```

### Prerequisites

You will need Docker Installed on your computer. Please take a look on the get started section.
